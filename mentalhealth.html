        <h3> Anxiety</h3>
    </section>
  <p>Anxiety is a feeling of fear or panic. Feeling generally anxious sometimes is normal. Most people worry about something - money or exams - but once the difficult situation is over, you feel better and calm down.If the problem has gone but the feeling of fear or panic stays or even gets stronger, that’s when anxiety becomes a problem. With as many as one in six young people experiencing anxiety at some point, it is very common to have anxiety.Take the first step – if you think you are affected by anxiety, talk to your GP or school nurse.If your health professional thinks you are suffering from anxiety, they will probably suggest a treatment plan for you to follow. They should catch up with you regularly to see how you’re getting on.There are three main ways of treating anxiety and they can be used on their own or sometimes your doctor will suggest you use more than one at once. The doctor may prescribe you antidepressants that help you think differently about the things worrying you. They usually take two to four weeks to start to work so don’t worry if you’re not feeling better straight away.</p>

    <h3> Depression</h3>
</section>
<p>Everyone has ups and downs. Sometimes you might feel a bit low, for lots of different reasons. People may say that they are feeling depressed when they are feeling down, but this does not always mean that they have depression.

epression is a long lasting low mood disorder. It affects your ability to do everyday things, feel pleasure or take interest in activities.

Depression is:

a mental illness that is recognised around the world,
common - it affects about one in ten of us,
something that anyone can get, and
treatable.
Depression is not:

something you can 'snap out of’,
a sign of weakness,
something that everyone experiences, or
something that lasts forever as one episode.
Doctors might describe depression as 'mild', 'moderate' or 'severe'. Your doctor may offer you different treatments depending on how they describe it.  <p/>
