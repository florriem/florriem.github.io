<p> When creating this website, our aims were to create a safe space for teenagers to go to, not only this but to offer advice. It is a spin off "Agony Aunts" were you can go with your problems anonymously and people advise anonymously.By having the anonymity it ensure that they will not feel so judged and can really open up. This was done to give a sense of community, were teenagers don't feel as alone as they do and sometimes talking to a stranger can help you open up. There is advise on family, friends and school problems, on how to study efficiently and mental health. There is also recommneded films, series and books. You can see what the latest trends are.By doing all of this, it helps ensure that teenagers do not feel as alone and have somewhere to turn to. In this way teenagers can feel supported and not so alone, can deal with situations and reach out if they need help.</p>
