<p> When creating this website, our aims were to create a safe space for teenagers to go to. It is a spin off "Agony Aunts" were people can ask and give advice anonymously. By having this anonymity it ensures that teenagers will not feel judged and have the opportunity to open up (sometimes talking to a stranger can help teenagers to open up.) By doing this it will give a sense of community, were teenagers don't feel alone and realise that they do not have to suffer in silence. There is advise on family, friends, school problems, on how to study efficiently and mental health. There is also recommended films, series and books, were you can see the latest trends.By doing all of this, it helps to ensure that teenagers feel that they are not alone and that there is someone that understands them. In this way teenagers can feel supported and make sensible decisions. </p>
